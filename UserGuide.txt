is given.


For version information, see Help->About.  MAKE
SURE YOU ARE USING THE RIGHT VERSION OF CATACLYSM.


HOW TO USE THIS SOFTWARE: ===============================

- Back up the 'raw' folder that contains the game
  JSONs (it's in [Cataclysm Root]/data).

- Run CataclysmModder.exe
- Go to File->Open
- Select the 'raw' folder mentioned above

Now the dropdown box in the top-left corner of the
program contains all the JSON data files that define
Cataclysm's content, though the program only supports
editing "item_groups.json" and the "item/" files for now.

Once you select a file from this box, the file's contents
are loaded into the "Entries" box under it, and if the
file can be edited, the editing area appears to the right.


USABILITY TIPS: ==========================================

You can type in the "Quicksearch" bar at the top right to
search the entries list by name or id. Press Enter to
scan through the search results.

You can press Ctrl+Space at any time to select the next
item matching the quicksearch.

You can use Ctrl+Up and Ctrl+Down at any time to navigate
up and down the entries list.

Some fields require the Id of an item (such as the Revert
To field on Tool items).  These fields will show suggestions
as you type in them.  To see the next suggestion, press
Ctrl+Tab.
